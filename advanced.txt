If running not out of a desktop.
Do the steps as mentioned.
Open ping federate admin console using remote address https://<remoteip>:9999.
Feed the base url of localhost.
Generate the java code as usual.
Edit pingfed-automation\automation-shared-lib\src\main\java\com\example\config\constants\AutomationSharedConstants.java
In HOSTNAME use the remote ip.
Using https://<remoteip>:9999/pingfederate/app#/protocolSettings edit
BASE URL so that it has remote ip.
go to pingfed-automation in command prompt/terminal
mvn clean package -P admin
After that go to pingfed-automation\admin-api-wrapper in command prompt/terminal
java -jar target/admin-api-wrapper.jar admin.Main

The first example should be runnable.

Second example without a desktop also possible but must setup proper ssl certificates in pingfederate.
